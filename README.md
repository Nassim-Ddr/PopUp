What is PopUp?  
  PopUp is my first game made using Unity, it's a simple 2D side scroller game where you have to use portals to pass throught levels.  

How does it work?  
  You can move by using the arrow keys (Or A and D), shoot portals with the right and left mouse click and when you step on a portal it teleports
  you the second one.  Who could guess ? :V
  The portal teleportation saves your physics (Velocity, Force direction etc) so you can for exemple shoot a portal on the floor and the other on the
  ceiling so you can accumulate horizontal velocity, and the shoot the ceiling portal to the ground to propel yourself up.

Note: The game is not 100% finished (mainly because i wanted to try something else) so there is no ui/menu elements in the game but the main
gameplay mechanics are implemented.
