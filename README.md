# About PopUp

**PopUp** is my debut creation in Unity, and it represents a straightforward 2D side-scrolling game that revolves around the clever usage of portals to navigate through various levels.

## How PopUp Works

You can move your character using the arrow keys, or alternatively, the A and D keys. The gameplay involves shooting portals by utilizing both the right and left mouse buttons. When you step onto one portal, it instantaneously teleports you to the corresponding portal's location.

What makes it interesting is that the portal teleportation retains your physical attributes, such as velocity and force direction. 
For instance, you can fire a portal on the floor and another on the ceiling to accumulate vertical velocity. Then, you can shoot the ceiling portal towards the ground, launching yourself upward.

Please note that PopUp is a work in progress, lacking certain elements like UI and menu components, as I wanted to explore some different creative directions. However, the core gameplay mechanics are fully implemented and ready for you to enjoy.
